# Weather-informator
Provides the detail about weather conditions in a city by using API (openweathermap) . 

**My first try in dealing with API's so the view may be very basic for you . 

Will continue to develop on this . 

Libraries Used: tkinter , requests , time .

### To make this work on your system you need to enter your api key in the code provided in 'first' file. 
### To get the api key just login into open weather map and copy the key from 'My keys' section .
